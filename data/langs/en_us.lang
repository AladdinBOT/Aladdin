[guild.join.message] = Hi,  my name is Aladdin, it looks like you want to come with me in my journey, I'll explain to you the basics.\n\nI'm a very complex administrative bot moved by customizable groups and permissions, I'll explain to you in simple words how this system works.\nTo create a group, you can use the command ``a!group create [name]`` and remember that groups with role names will be connected automatically.\nTo add a permission to the group use the command ``a!group addperm [name] [permission]``, the permissions are called nodes and accept suffixes like ``*`` to grant all permissions from that node, for instance, if you use the permission ``command.*`` that will grant all commands available, well, you can list all nodes by typing ``a!group nodes``.\n\nI know that sometime you will want to revoke a  permission from some member for something, but calm down, you don't need to create a separate grupo for that, to revoke or grant a permission you can use the command ``a!user addperm -[permission] [@member]`` to remove the permission from a member where the ``-`` indicates that he will no longer have permissoin to that permission, I think you got it by this point if you want to add permissions to a member just remove the ``-``.\n\nAHHHHHH, I almost forgot, what's the use for creating groups without adding members? To define a member's group, you can use  ``a!user setgroup [group] [@member]``.\n\nYou can change some of my permissions, take a looke at the command ``a!config`` if you're interested, you can get some examples by using ``a!help config``.\n\nI hope you have fun with me :smiley: and if you need help, join my guild! https://discord.gg/ANVp6qv
