To define a member's group, you can use  ``a!user setgroup [group] [@member]``.\n\nYou can change some of my permissions, take a looke at the command ``a!config`` if you're interested, you can get some examples by using ``a!help config``.\n\nI hope you have fun with me :smiley: and if you need help, join my guild! https://discord.gg/ANVp6qv
