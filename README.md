About Aladdin
========
Hi, my name is Aladdin. In case you didn't know, I was inspired by the anime [Magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi:_The_Labyrinth_of_Magic "Magi"), my focus are administrative actions however I can be really useful in other things, such as fun commands or music, being developed by `HeyZeer0#0190`. In my adventure I'm followed by my great friends Ali Baba and Morgiana, maybe you'll find them around. My goal is to learn more and more about this world, you can bring me to your guild by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=321349548712656896&scope=bot&permissions=2146958463 "here")! So, would you like to be my friend?

Building your own instance
========
I actually have no idea why you would want to self-host your own version of Aladdin, but first of all there is some rules for it:

 - I'm **not going** to support your self hosted version of Aladdin.
 - The source code is under AGPL, so **your source needs to be public**.
 - The main idea of leaving the source public is for educational purpose, allowing people to see my code and learn over it, try to fix it and such, not creating a copy saying "Hey look, I've made a Discord Bot" since you did not.
 - All the assets of the bot **are public** but **over my copyright**, so you probably shoudn't use them.

Requirements:

 1. RethinkDB Database
 2. Tons of API keys
 3. Maven and Gradle
 4. JDK 8+

I'm not going to create a full tutorial on how to build it, but you only need to use the cmd

> gradle shadowJar

Again, **I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO SELF HOST THE BOT**.

Pull Request
========

All pull requests are welcome, I'll analyse it and if it fits in the main purpose of the bot I'll implement it.
If you are going to create something with text, don't forget to use the lang system.

All help is welcome =)
